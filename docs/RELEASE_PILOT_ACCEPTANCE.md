## Verified repository checkpoint — 2026-11-14 17:48 CET

**Release decision: NOT READY. Pilot/production acceptance: NOT GRANTED.** This checkpoint supersedes the 17:16 CET status summary below; older checkpoints are retained as historical evidence.

### Repository and governance
- Repository visibility is **public temporarily**, pending the owner's final public/private decision. Main HEAD remains `f03d2390f5ee8a6c549e2466c2c1a5844e08fbc1`. The active `Protect main` ruleset [26370589](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/rules/26370589) targets the default branch, requires PRs, one approval, stale-review dismissal, last-push approval, resolved review threads, strict `CodeQL`, `backend`, `frontend`, `ios`, `analyze`, and `dependency-review` checks, blocks deletion/non-fast-forward updates, and has no bypass actors. Issue [#47](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/issues/47) remains open until the owner confirms the final visibility/plan and enforcement is reverified after any change.
- PR [#41](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/pull/41) is closed/merged from reviewed source HEAD `68b380e73ca3c870048035197beef8febbf90ef1`; merge and main HEAD are `f03d2390f5ee8a6c549e2466c2c1a5844e08fbc1`. Exact-head Validation [43492153234](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43492153234), CodeQL [43492153161](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43492153161), and Dependency Review [43492153021](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43492153021) passed. Review inventory: 108 combined timeline records, 52 conversation comments, 30 inline comments, 22/22 threads resolved, 26 review submissions (25 COMMENTED, one human APPROVED by `tarlaci1984-sketch`). The source branch remains at the reviewed SHA.
- The GitHub Releases API returned an empty array: **0 published releases**. Complete Code Scanning, Dependabot, and Secret Scanning alert inventories remain **unavailable/unverified, not empty** through the connected integration.

### Current exact-head release documentation — PR #85
- PR [#85](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/pull/85) remains open and unmerged on `docs/post-merge-release-evidence-20261113`, exact HEAD `7ad4ffe14637e2072e8656b461a27eb32085aa25` (31 commits, three changed release records).
- Exact-head Validation [43614974247](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43614974247), CodeQL [43614974171](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43614974171), and Dependency Review [43614974249](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43614974249) are all **SUCCESS**. Validation jobs: backend 13/13 steps, frontend 17/17, iOS 11/11; CodeQL 8/8; Dependency Review 5/5.
- Backend log: **450 tests**, **27 readiness checks**, and **78 security/privacy checks** passed; `pip-audit` reported no known Python dependency vulnerabilities. Frontend typecheck/unit tests, Expo Doctor, Android Release build, and Android emulator smoke passed. iOS Release simulator build and simulator smoke passed.
- CodeQL generated JavaScript/Python SARIF, combined it, successfully uploaded the results, and completed analysis. A non-fatal SARIF column-kind mismatch warning remains. Dependency Review succeeded on this documentation-only diff; it scanned no changed dependency files, so this is not a full dependency-alert inventory.
- The current PR #85 has one resolved inline review thread and one COMMENTED review submission; **no human APPROVED review** is recorded. Keep it open/unmerged pending human approval and the owner's integration decision.

### SSRF security integration — PRs #95/#99 and issue #64
- Parent PR [#95](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/pull/95), exact HEAD `35f8afe5fd947d25b1d9d6fa55e40f02365dcb67`, has Validation [43595304397](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43595304397) **FAILED** with 507 passed / 1 failed: a regression expected resolver input order rather than the transport's deterministic sorted IP order. Parent CodeQL [43595304402](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43595304402) and Dependency Review [43595304460](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43595304460) passed. The child result does not make the parent Validation green.
- Child PR [#99](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/pull/99) has been retargeted directly to `main` at unchanged source HEAD `e15392a0dbb0c9bbcb8dd0d83e02d4c972a42cc9`. Its Validation [43604802611](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43604802611), CodeQL [43604802662](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43604802662), and Dependency Review [43604802669](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43604802669) passed **before the retarget** while the source was stacked on #95. These are exact-source results, but no fresh post-retarget PR-triggered workflow runs were returned in the current audit. Do not represent them as new main-based PR checks.
- The passing source suite recorded backend **508 passed**, readiness **27 passed**, production-security **78 passed**, cryptography 50.0.2, and no known Python dependency vulnerabilities. It covers real HTTPX/httpcore TCP/TLS numeric-peer pinning, original Host/SNI preservation, mismatched-peer rejection before TLS/request bytes, redirect-hop DNS re-resolution/pinning, DNS-rebinding rejection before the second TCP connect, mixed DNS, NAT64/IPv6 transition-address embedded-private IPv4, multicast, empty answers, and bounded DNS/connect deadlines. Android and iOS emulator/simulator validation passed on that source run.
- Issue [#64](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/issues/64) remains **OPEN** pending fresh exact-head checks on the main-based PR #99, human security review, and authorized integration. No production security acceptance is claimed.

### Dependency and security-alert status
- The current PR #85 frontend runtime audit `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` reports **3 moderate** vulnerabilities and no high-or-higher finding at the configured threshold. The Expo fingerprint/minimatch compatibility constraint remains; no incompatible major override, forced Expo downgrade, audit-threshold reduction, or test removal was used. Dependency-risk item #3 remains In Progress.
- Issue [#84](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/issues/84) contains an older in-progress snapshot. It is superseded for PR #85's current exact HEAD by the successful CodeQL SARIF upload and Dependency Review runs above. The full alert inventories remain unavailable/unverified, and the final repository visibility/plan decision remains open; do not close the issue or claim alert inventories are empty based only on workflow success.

### Authoritative 25-point release register
- **2 Done / 15 In Progress / 8 Blocked.** Done: #1 iOS CI closure and #6 Redis multi-instance concurrency. Blocked: #2 main branch protection durability/final visibility decision, #4 physical iPhone App Attest and production entitlement, #5 Play-installed physical Android Play Integrity, #16 witnessed production backup/restore, #18 representative product-recognition benchmark/business acceptance, #21 production monitoring and alert delivery, #22 approved staged rollout and tested rollback, and #25 real-user pilot/business sign-off. The other 15 remain In Progress.
- CI, CodeQL, SARIF upload, emulator, and simulator evidence do not satisfy physical-device, production-cloud, witnessed recovery, monitoring, rollout, real-user pilot, or business-approval gates. Pilot/production acceptance remains **NOT GRANTED**.

## Verified repository checkpoint — 2026-11-14 17:16 CET

**Release decision: NOT READY. Pilot/production acceptance: NOT GRANTED.**

### Repository and governance
- Live inventory: **74 branches / 40 open PRs / 8 open issues**. Repository visibility is **public**, still described as temporary by the owner.
- Main HEAD: `f03d2390f5ee8a6c549e2466c2c1a5844e08fbc1`. The main branch object reports `protected: true`; active repository ruleset [Protect main, ID 26370589](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/rules/26370589) requires PRs, one approval, stale-review dismissal, last-push approval, resolved review threads, strict CodeQL/backend/frontend/iOS/analyze/Dependency Review checks, and blocks deletion/non-fast-forward updates with no bypass actors. No protection setting was changed. The owner must still decide the final public/private plan and re-verify after any visibility change.
- PR #41 is merged from reviewed HEAD `68b380e73ca3c870048035197beef8febbf90ef1`; merge/current main is `f03d2390f5ee8a6c549e2466c2c1a5844e08fbc1`. All 22/22 inline review threads are resolved, one human APPROVED review exists, and both Redis runbook P2 findings are resolved.

### Current exact-head PR evidence

Redis PEXPIRE preflight and TTL-preservation regressions are validated.
- **PR #99**, child of #95, exact HEAD `e15392a0dbb0c9bbcb8dd0d83e02d4c972a42cc9`: Validation [43604802611](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43604802611), CodeQL [43604802662](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43604802662), Dependency Review [43604802669](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43604802669) all **SUCCESS**. Backend **508 passed**, readiness **27 passed**, production security **78 passed**, cryptography **50.0.2**, pip-audit reported no known Python vulnerabilities. The exact-head suite proves real HTTPX/httpcore TCP/TLS pinned-peer behavior, original Host/SNI, mismatch rejection before TLS/request, per-redirect-hop DNS re-resolution/pinning, and DNS-rebinding rejection before the second TCP connect. Frontend Android and iOS validation also passed. No human security review; child remains draft/stacked/unmerged.
- **PR #95 parent** exact HEAD `35f8afe5fd947d25b1d9d6fa55e40f02365dcb67`: Validation [43595304397](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43595304397) failed on one backend assertion (**507 passed / 1 failed**) because the test expected resolver input order instead of deterministic sorted IP order; CodeQL [43595304402](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43595304402) and Dependency Review [43595304460](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43595304460) passed. Child #99 corrects the test expectation but does not make parent #95 green. Keep issue #64 open pending integration and independent human security review.
- **PR #100** exact HEAD `995b1dca73ef3de64fc956427acde29a49436575`: Validation [43605093521](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43605093521) failed on the original frontend AST Set/arrayContaining assertion (**304 passed / 1 failed**); CodeQL [43605093391](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43605093391) and Dependency Review [43605093460](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43605093460) passed. Child #101 contains the isolated test-only correction.
- **PR #101**, child of #100, exact HEAD `a91434c1669ad159fa50fd3526b6594f2c2f8ebd`: Validation [43605226464](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43605226464), CodeQL [43605226487](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43605226487), Dependency Review [43605226520](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43605226520) all **SUCCESS**. Backend 450, readiness 27, production security 78; frontend typecheck/unit, Expo Doctor, Android release/emulator, and iOS release/simulator checks passed.
- **PR #102**, child of #96, exact HEAD `1dce62ad4907b096a32d76785cf1e695f0f7bb71`: Validation [43605416452](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43605416452), CodeQL [43605416392](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43605416392), Dependency Review [43605416335](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43605416335) all **SUCCESS**. It corrects USEIT product-scope/privacy guidance. The shared runtime npm audit still reports **3 moderate minimatch advisories** via Expo → @expo/fingerprint; no incompatible major override or forced Expo downgrade was applied.

### Historical priority PR disposition
- **PR #65** is closed without merge. Its historical exact HEAD `678fe7fde32f4dc785288d5a8ac939f1ac6478f0` passed Validation [43452488602](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43452488602), CodeQL [43452493289](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43452493289), and Dependency Review [43452488754](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43452488754). The Node 22 Expo plugin/runtime split is present on main and the main post-merge prebuild validation succeeded.
- **PR #67** is closed without merge; its historical Validation failed with 18 npm audit findings and two App Attest backend test failures. Do not reuse it as current mainline evidence.
- **PR #68** is closed without merge; its historical exact-head Validation [43436750104](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43436750104), CodeQL [43436750094](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43436750094), and Dependency Review [43436750108](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43436750108) all succeeded; backend 177 passed, cryptography 50.0.2, pip-audit clean.
- **PR #69** is closed without merge; its historical Validation failed on the old dependency/backend regressions, while Node 22 iOS prebuild succeeded. The current mainline config-plugin/runtime separation is validated independently.

### Authoritative release and acceptance state
- The 25-point register remains **2 Done / 15 In Progress / 8 Blocked**. Done: #1 iOS CI closure and #6 Redis multi-instance concurrency. Blocked: #2 final visibility/plan decision, #4 physical iPhone App Attest/production entitlement, #5 Play-installed physical Android Play Integrity, #16 witnessed production backup/restore, #18 representative product-recognition benchmark/business acceptance, #21 production monitoring/alert delivery, #22 staged rollout/rollback approval, and #25 real-user pilot/business sign-off. The other 15 remain In Progress.
- Code Scanning/Dependency Review workflows now execute successfully in the temporary public state; this does not expose or prove the full alert inventory. Alert inventories remain unavailable/unverified, not empty.
- External console setup, physical-device tests, production cloud access, witnessed recovery, monitoring, staged rollout, real-user pilot and business approval remain blocked until independent evidence exists. CI, simulator, and emulator results do not satisfy those gates.
- No merge is authorized by this checkpoint. Human approval, final repository visibility decision, and external release acceptance remain separate gates.

## Verified repository checkpoint — 2026-11-14 16:09 CET

**Release decision: NOT READY. Pilot/production acceptance: NOT GRANTED.**

### Live repository and governance evidence
- Repository visibility is currently **public** (owner-described as temporary). Current default branch is main, HEAD f03d2390f5ee8a6c549e2466c2c1a5844e08fbc1.
- Live branch inventory: **74 branches**. Live search inventory: **40 open pull requests / 8 open issues**.
- Main branch object reports protected: true. Repository ruleset [Protect main, ID 26370589](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/rules/26370589) is **active**, targets the default branch, has no bypass actors, blocks deletion and non-fast-forward updates, and requires PRs, one approval, stale-review dismissal, last-push approval, and resolved review threads.
- The active ruleset requires strict status checks CodeQL, backend, frontend, ios, analyze, and dependency-review. The legacy branch-protection subresource is not the enforcement source; no branch-protection or ruleset setting was changed by this checkpoint.
- Keep the final visibility/plan decision with the owner. If the repository is returned to private visibility, re-verify ruleset availability and enforcement before treating this temporary-public state as durable.

### Merged release baseline — PR #41

Backend: **508 tests**, 27 readiness checks, 78 production-security checks; cryptography 50.0.2 and pip-audit clean. The passing suite includes real HTTPX/httpcore TCP/TLS peer pinning, original Host/SNI preservation, peer-mismatch rejection before TLS/request, per-redirect-hop DNS re-resolution/pinning, and DNS-rebinding rejection before the second TCP connection. Frontend Android and iOS validation also succeeded. No human security review is recorded; keep #64 open.

The correction describes USEIT as consumer product discovery/visual assistance and prioritizes user photos, session tokens, attestation payloads, credentials and personal data. Backend: 450 tests, 27 readiness checks, 78 production-security checks; cryptography 50.0.2, pip-audit clean; frontend and iOS/Android simulator/build checks succeeded. No human review is recorded.
- **PR #97**, HEAD 6212c217e700e6cf263d6f98e0481af4888c3fa4: Validation [43600898776](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43600898776), CodeQL [43600898781](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43600898781), and Dependency Review [43600898787](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43600898787) all **SUCCESS**. It adds Redis PEXPIRE readiness regressions, including both-key preflight and TTL preservation on a later probe failure. No human review is recorded.
- **PR #100**, HEAD 995b1dca73ef3de64fc956427acde29a49436575: CodeQL [43605093391](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43605093391) and Dependency Review [43605093460](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43605093460) succeeded. Validation [43605093521](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43605093521) has a frontend AST assertion failure (**304 passed / 1 failed**) caused by comparing a Set directly with arrayContaining; its iOS simulator smoke step was still running at the last job read. The test-only correction is in child PR #101; do not overwrite #100.
- **PR #101**, child of #100, HEAD a91434c1669ad159fa50fd3526b6594f2c2f8ebd: Validation [43605226464](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43605226464), CodeQL [43605226487](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43605226487), and Dependency Review [43605226520](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43605226520) all **SUCCESS**. Backend: 450 tests, 27 readiness, 78 production security; cryptography 50.0.2 and pip-audit clean. Frontend typecheck, unit tests, Expo Doctor, Android export/release/emulator checks, and iOS release/simulator checks succeeded. No human review is recorded.

All child PRs #99–#102 remain draft/stacked/unmerged. Parent PRs #95 and #100 are not silently treated as green from their child PRs. Do not merge automatically.

### Authoritative release register and external acceptance
- The 25-point register remains **2 Done / 15 In Progress / 8 Blocked**. Done: #1 iOS CI closure and #6 Redis multi-instance concurrency. Blocked: #2 final main-protection/visibility-plan confirmation; #4 physical iPhone App Attest; #5 Play-installed physical Android Play Integrity; #16 witnessed production backup/restore; #18 representative product-recognition benchmark/business acceptance; #21 production monitoring/alert delivery; #22 staged rollout/rollback approval; #25 real-user pilot/business approval. The other 15 remain In Progress.
- Current ruleset evidence proves main is protected in the temporary-public configuration, but item #2 remains blocked until the owner confirms the final visibility/plan choice and the same enforcement is re-verified after any visibility change.
- External console setup, physical-device testing, production cloud access, witnessed recovery, monitoring, staged rollout, real-user pilot and business approval remain **Blocked** until independent evidence exists. CI/simulator/emulator results do not satisfy these gates.

### Acceptance boundary
The exact-head CI results above establish automated validation only. They do not grant physical-device, production-cloud, witnessed recovery, monitoring, staged-rollout, real-user-pilot or business acceptance. Pilot/production acceptance remains NOT GRANTED.

#### Dependency, governance and repository inventory
- PR #98 is closed without merge: its root `minimatch@11.0.5` override conflicts with `@expo/fingerprint@0.20.16` declaring `^10.2.6`. PR #81's separate legacy-base audit reports 3 moderate, 0 high and 0 critical findings; that does not remediate current main. Item #3 remains In Progress; do not force an unsupported override.
- Repository visibility is private. Current main branch metadata reports `protected:false` and required-status enforcement `off`; branch-protection reads return HTTP 403 and rulesets reads return HTTP 403 with GitHub's GitHub Pro/public-visibility requirement. Issue [#47](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/issues/47) remains open. The 2026-11-02 ruleset snapshot is historical, not proof of current enforcement.
- Issue [#84](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/issues/84) records that Code Scanning is not enabled and Dependency Graph / GitHub Advanced Security is unavailable or not enabled for this private-repository configuration.
- Releases API: 0 published releases. Repository inventory: 70 branches, 36 open PRs, 7 open issues. Code Scanning, Dependabot and Secret Scanning alert inventories are unavailable/unverified, not empty.

#### Authoritative 25-point register
- **2 Done / 15 In Progress / 8 Blocked.** Done: #1 iOS CI closure and #6 Redis multi-instance concurrency. Blocked: #2 main branch protection; #4 physical iPhone App Attest; #5 Play-installed physical Android Play Integrity; #16 witnessed production backup/restore; #18 representative product-recognition benchmark/business acceptance; #21 production monitoring/alert delivery; #22 staged rollout/rollback approval; #25 real-user pilot/business approval. The other 15 remain In Progress.
- Pilot/production acceptance remains **NOT GRANTED**. External console setup, physical-device testing, production cloud access, witnessed recovery, staged rollout and real-user/business approval remain blocked until independent evidence exists.

This accepts the merged automated baseline only.

### Documentation and security candidates
- PR #85 exact HEAD `32b7c300eb3be3f2bd548bbba40090da7a32ec01` has its own terminal Validation [43592077952](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43592077952), CodeQL [43592077937](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43592077937), and Dependency Review [43592077920](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43592077920) failures. All five jobs have no executed steps. Its documentation is not integrated into main.
- PR #95 exact HEAD `35f8afe5fd947d25b1d9d6fa55e40f02365dcb67` has its own terminal Validation [43595304397](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43595304397), CodeQL [43595304402](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43595304402), and Dependency Review [43595304460](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43595304460) failures. All five jobs have no executed steps. DNS pinning, timeout, NAT64/multicast, pinned-peer, and real-socket regressions are not executed/accepted on this HEAD. Issue #64 remains open.
- PR #98 was closed without merge because its minimatch 11.0.5 root override violates Expo fingerprint's declared `^10.2.6` range. No clean dependency audit or compatible mainline remediation is claimed.

### Governance and external acceptance
- Issue #47 remains open. A fresh main branch read reports `protected:false` and required-status enforcement `off`; the rulesets endpoint returns HTTP 403 under the current private-repository plan. Issue #84 tracks unavailable Code Scanning / Dependency Graph capabilities.
- The releases API returned an empty list. Code Scanning, Dependabot, and Secret Scanning alert inventories are unavailable through the connected integration, not verified empty.
- **Blocked external gates:** #2 main branch protection; #4 physical iPhone App Attest; #5 Play-installed physical Android Play Integrity; #16 witnessed production backup/restore; #18 representative product-recognition benchmark and business acceptance; #21 production monitoring/alert delivery; #22 staged rollout/rollback approval; #25 real-user pilot/business approval.
- Simulator/emulator runs, injected backends, and CI on another SHA do not satisfy physical-device, production-cloud, witnessed recovery, monitoring, rollout, pilot, or business acceptance. No external gate is promoted by this checkpoint.

### Follow-up exact-head CI result — PR #85 checkpoint commit
- The preceding documentation update was committed as `072ab3bdabbb9cfcbc6cd954b47cc7d446f8be55`; PR #85 now points to this exact HEAD (23 commits, three release-record files).
- Exact-head Validation [43589918942](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43589918942), CodeQL [43589918950](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43589918950), and Dependency Review [43589918966](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43589918966) all completed with failure.
- Five jobs (backend `132432256450`, frontend `132432256636`, iOS `132432256700`, CodeQL `132432256536`, Dependency Review `132432256079`) each have zero executed steps. Sampled job-log downloads return HTTP 404 `BlobNotFound`.
- No tests, native builds, CodeQL scan, or Dependency Review execution is evidenced on this exact HEAD. This is not an application assertion failure and is not a pass. The exact GitHub-side dispatch/log-storage cause remains unverified.
- The current 25-row register is **2 Done / 15 In Progress / 8 Blocked**. Row #2 is **Blocked** because live main metadata reports `protected:false` and required-status enforcement `off`; branch-protection/rulesets reads return HTTP 403 under the current private-repository plan. Issue #47 remains open.
- No further commit should be made until these exact-head checks are reconciled with GitHub Actions execution availability. Pilot/production acceptance remains **NOT GRANTED**.

### Acceptance boundary
- The successful PR #41 exact-head CI accepts the merged automated application baseline only.
- PR #85's current documentation HEAD failed before executing steps; its records are not accepted or integrated into main.
- PR #95's SSRF multicast/NAT64/DNS regression tests remain unexecuted on its exact head. Issue #64 stays open.
- PR #98 was closed without merge because its global minimatch 11 override violates Expo fingerprint's declared range. The moderate build-tooling audit finding remains visible; no clean audit is claimed.
- Row #2 main branch protection is Blocked. External items #4, #5, #16, #18, #21, #22, and #25 remain Blocked pending physical-device, production, witnessed recovery, monitoring, rollout, and real-user/business evidence.

- PR #41 review: 22/22 inline threads resolved; 26 submissions (25 COMMENTED, one human APPROVED). This accepts the merged automated application baseline only.

### Documentation acceptance
- PR #85 current exact HEAD `71116d40a7e1a36bea015fc7c8da8d6043e911c9` remains open/unmerged. Its own Validation [43586364962](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43586364962), CodeQL [43586364980](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43586364980), and Dependency Review [43586364929](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43586364929) all failed before executing any steps. Five jobs have empty step lists and sampled log downloads return `BlobNotFound`. No documentation or application test result is inferred. The new checkpoint commit requires its own exact-head checks and human review.

### Security and dependency acceptance
- PR #95 current exact HEAD `aec819f2c4ff321611ff7a4899e7d0666b0cd845` adds explicit multicast/reserved/unspecified destination rejection to the SSRF DNS-pinned transport, with syntax, DNS-answer, peer, and pre-TCP transport regressions. Validation [43586519237](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43586519237), CodeQL [43586519299](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43586519299), and Dependency Review [43586519266](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43586519266) failed before steps; the new tests have not executed. Issue #64 remains open; no integrated SSRF acceptance is claimed.
- PR #98 was closed without merge because a global minimatch 11 override violates `@expo/fingerprint@0.20.16`'s declared minimatch 10 range and upstream compatibility work remains unresolved. PR #81's separate legacy-base full npm audit reports 3 moderate, 0 high, 0 critical findings. Expo's maintainer assessment describes the fingerprint finding as local build tooling rather than shipped-app runtime. Keep the moderate finding visible; do not claim a clean audit or force the override.

### Governance and external acceptance
- Main is private and currently reports `protected: false` with required-status-check enforcement off. Branch-protection and rulesets reads return HTTP 403; issue #47 remains open. The current main ruleset is not verified.
- Issue #84 records Code Scanning disabled and Dependency Graph / GitHub Advanced Security unavailable or not enabled for this private-repository configuration. Required checks remain mandatory.
- The current register is **2 Done / 15 In Progress / 8 Blocked**. Blocked items: #2 main protection; #4 physical iPhone App Attest; #5 Play-installed physical Android Play Integrity; #16 witnessed production backup/restore; #18 representative product-recognition benchmark/business acceptance; #21 production monitoring/alert delivery; #22 staged rollout/rollback approval; #25 real-user pilot/business approval.
- GitHub Releases API returned 0 published releases. Security alert inventories remain unavailable/unverified, not empty. No repository CI result substitutes for production or pilot acceptance.

Physical-device verification, production cloud/provider access, witnessed backup/restore, monitoring/alert delivery, staged rollout/rollback approval, and real-user pilot/business approval remain blocked until independent evidence exists.

**Pilot/production acceptance: NOT GRANTED.**

### Automated application baseline
- PR #41 reviewed exact HEAD `68b380e73ca3c870048035197beef8febbf90ef1` passed Validation `43492153234`, CodeQL `43492153161`, and Dependency Review `43492153021`, then merged as main `f03d2390f5ee8a6c549e2466c2c1a5844e08fbc1`.
- Post-merge main Validation `43503743786` and CodeQL `43503743752` passed. No separate post-merge Dependency Review is claimed.
- PR #41 review: 22/22 inline threads resolved, 26 review submissions, one human APPROVED review. Both Redis runbook P2 findings are resolved. This accepts the merged automated application baseline only.

### Current documentation gate
- PR #85 pre-write HEAD `3ec68482a31c974e6955d4f846ed47446ea29992`; Validation `43585978140`, CodeQL `43585978083`, and Dependency Review `43585978102` all failed before steps with no logs. This documentation update requires its own exact-head checks and human review.
- The main branch still contains the historical 3 Done / 15 In Progress / 7 Blocked register and marks main protection Done. The PR #85 candidate corrects row #2 to Blocked and the register to **2 Done / 15 In Progress / 8 Blocked**. It is not merged; main's documents remain stale until approved integration.

### Security and dependency acceptance
- PR #95 exact HEAD `adac0e6dd6525b197ba7433f290e2afb017d7903` includes DNS-pinned HTTPX/httpcore transport, per-hop DNS/public-address validation, numeric-IP connection pinning, Host/TLS SNI preservation, peer checks, DNS/connect deadline handling, and NAT64 embedded-private-IPv4 rejection. Its Validation `43578843298`, CodeQL `43578843319`, and Dependency Review `43578843263` failed before steps; the NAT64 and timeout tests have not executed. Issue #64 remains open. No SSRF integration acceptance is claimed.
- PR #98 was closed without merge. Its global minimatch 11 override conflicts with `@expo/fingerprint@0.20.16`'s declared minimatch 10 range. Expo upstream issue #52735 says fingerprint retains minimatch 10 due to breaking changes and assesses the finding as local CLI/build tooling rather than shipped-app vulnerability. Keep the moderate audit finding visible; do not claim a clean npm audit.
- PR #90 HEAD `a603fd181d963c0a0da9a367560711fb29f71593`, #96 HEAD `598735d45bcd34570b6fb1887cd380432c58bbf2`, and #97 HEAD `a2c02acfe4fa9861b765e80f88316c7060a97f59` all have failed-before-step Validation/CodeQL/Dependency Review runs. No acceptance is inferred from source presence.

### Governance and external release gates
- Main is private and currently reports `protected:false`; rulesets and branch-protection reads return HTTP 403. Issue #47 remains open. Issue #84 records the separate Code Scanning and Dependency Graph / Advanced Security capability blockers.
- The release register is **2 Done / 15 In Progress / 8 Blocked**. Blocked items: #2 main protection; #4 physical iPhone App Attest; #5 Play-installed physical Android Play Integrity; #16 witnessed production backup/restore; #18 representative product-recognition benchmark/business acceptance; #21 production monitoring/alert delivery; #22 staged rollout/rollback approval; #25 real-user pilot/business approval.
- The repository inventory is 70 branch names, 36 open PRs, and 7 open issues. No production or pilot acceptance is granted by these repository checks.

No external gate is promoted to Done. Physical-device, production-cloud, witnessed backup/restore, monitoring, staged rollout/rollback, and real-user pilot/business evidence remain required.

**Pilot/production acceptance: NOT GRANTED.**

### Automated application baseline

PR [#41](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/pull/41) is closed and merged at reviewed exact HEAD `68b380e73ca3c870048035197beef8febbf90ef1`, merge/current main `f03d2390f5ee8a6c549e2466c2c1a5844e08fbc1`. Exact-head Validation [43492153234](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43492153234), CodeQL [43492153161](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43492153161), and Dependency Review [43492153021](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43492153021) passed. PR #41 review has 22/22 resolved inline threads and one human APPROVED submission among 26 reviews. This accepts the automated application baseline only.

### Documentation exact-head gate

PR [#85](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/pull/85) remains open/unmerged at pre-update exact HEAD `277555f5f07752a3313e3a30d071f424d195c141`. Its own Validation [43577412306](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43577412306), CodeQL [43577412333](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43577412333), and Dependency Review [43577412275](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43577412275) failed. Five jobs have empty step lists and sampled logs return HTTP 404 `BlobNotFound`; no tests or scans executed on this SHA. The cause remains unverified. This new documentation checkpoint requires its own exact-head checks; parent or PR #41 results are not substituted.

### SSRF security acceptance — issue #64 / PR #95

Issue [#64](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/issues/64) remains open. Draft PR [#95](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/pull/95) exact HEAD `adac0e6dd6525b197ba7433f290e2afb017d7903` contains bounded DNS/connect deadlines and NAT64 well-known-prefix embedded-IPv4 rejection, with deterministic URL/DNS/transport/peer regression tests. Its Validation [43578843298](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43578843298) failed on attempt 2; CodeQL [43578843319](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43578843319) and Dependency Review [43578843263](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43578843263) failed. The five jobs did not execute steps and sampled logs are unavailable. The NAT64 and transport tests have **not executed** on this exact HEAD. No SSRF integration acceptance or production deployment is claimed.

### Dependency remediation acceptance — PRs #81 and #98

PR #81's full npm audit passed on its own older release-remediation branch and reported 3 moderate, 0 high, 0 critical advisories, including a minimatch globparts-amplification DoS affecting 7.0.0–11.0.0. Main-based draft PR [#98](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/pull/98) proposes `minimatch@11.0.5` and compatibility regressions. Its exact-head Validation [43579189877](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43579189877), CodeQL [43579189858](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43579189858), and Dependency Review [43579189714](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43579189714) failed before steps. The override and tests are not accepted until they execute on the exact main-based head and receive review.

### Governance and external acceptance

Issue [#47](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/issues/47) remains open/reopened. Main reports `protected: false`; rulesets and branch-protection reads are blocked by HTTP 403 under the current private-repository configuration. Issue [#84](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/issues/84) records Code Scanning and Dependency Graph / GitHub Advanced Security capability blockers. Security alert inventories remain unavailable/unverified, not empty. The GitHub Releases API returns 0 published releases.

The 25-point register remains **2 Done / 15 In Progress / 8 Blocked**. Blocked items: #2 main branch protection; #4 physical iPhone App Attest; #5 Play-installed physical Android Play Integrity; #16 witnessed production backup/restore; #18 representative product-recognition benchmark/business acceptance; #21 production monitoring/alert delivery; #22 staged rollout/rollback approval; #25 real-user pilot/business approval.

- **#4 App Attest:** Apple production App ID/capability and provisioning entitlement, signed production build, and provider-backed enrollment/assertion on a supported physical iPhone.
- **#5 Play Integrity:** Google Play internal-track distribution, Play App Signing identity, Google Cloud service-account/API permissions, and verification on a physical Android installed from Play.
- **#16 Backup/restore:** witnessed production backup and restore with measured recovery-point and recovery-time evidence.
- **#18 Product accuracy:** representative labeled dataset, measured accuracy, human evaluation, and business acceptance.
- **#21 Monitoring:** production metrics/log pipeline, named on-call owner, and verified alert delivery/acknowledgement.
- **#22 Rollout:** approved staged rollout thresholds, named rollback owner, and tested rollback.
- **#25 Pilot:** real-user cohort, measured acceptance criteria, participant safeguards, and business sign-off.

Simulator/emulator CI, injected network backends, and repository-only checks do not satisfy physical-device, production-cloud, witnessed recovery, monitoring, rollout, pilot, or business acceptance.

Its exact-head Validation [43492153234](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43492153234), CodeQL [43492153161](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43492153161), and Dependency Review [43492153021](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43492153021) passed. Post-merge main Validation [43503743786](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43503743786) and CodeQL [43503743752](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43503743752) passed. These establish automated CI evidence for the merged application baseline only.

### Documentation branch exact-head gate

PR [#85](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/pull/85) remains open and unmerged at exact HEAD `f05c85f85e5f38ee6c36f74e784dd3cbbfd38b78`. Its Validation [43556921830](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43556921830), CodeQL [43556921835](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43556921835), and Dependency Review [43556921848](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43556921848) all failed before runner assignment. Backend, frontend, iOS, CodeQL, and Dependency Review jobs each report `runner_id: 0`, empty runner name, zero steps, and no retrievable logs. No tests or scans executed on this exact HEAD. The GitHub-side dispatch/runner cause remains unverified. Do not reuse PR #41 or parent-commit CI as evidence for PR #85.

### Governance and external acceptance

The private repository's current `main` branch reports `protected: false`; rulesets reads are blocked by GitHub HTTP 403 on the current plan/visibility combination. Issue [#47](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/issues/47) remains open for owner action. Issue [#84](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/issues/84) records the Code Scanning and Dependency Graph / Advanced Security capability blockers. Security alert inventories are unavailable/unverified, not empty.

The release register remains **2 Done / 15 In Progress / 8 Blocked**. Blocked items are #2 main protection, #4 physical iPhone App Attest, #5 Play-installed Android Play Integrity, #16 witnessed production backup/restore, #18 product-recognition benchmark/business acceptance, #21 production monitoring/alert delivery, #22 staged rollout/rollback approval, and #25 real-user pilot/business approval. Physical-device tests, production cloud access, witnessed recovery, rollout approval, and pilot/business acceptance have not been evidenced.

No published GitHub release is present in the current releases API response. Store, production, and pilot acceptance remain **NOT GRANTED**.

These results establish automated CI acceptance for the merged code only, not production or pilot acceptance.

### Current documentation gate — PR #85

PR [#85](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/pull/85) remains open at exact HEAD `c1c85ad27bd43176f981516bbffd2676bbda452b`, targeting `main` at `f03d2390f5ee8a6c549e2466c2c1a5844e08fbc1`. Its exact-head Validation [43550836422](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43550836422), CodeQL [43550836413](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43550836413), and Dependency Review [43550836406](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43550836406) all completed with failure before runner assignment. All five jobs started at 03:17:14 UTC and completed at 03:17:16 UTC with `runner_id: 0`, empty runner name, zero steps, and no downloadable logs (HTTP 404 `BlobNotFound`). No application test, Android/iOS build, CodeQL scan, or Dependency Review step executed on this exact HEAD. The precise GitHub-side dispatch cause remains unverified; do not describe this as a code test failure or a pass. No human approval for current PR #85 HEAD is recorded. Its only inline review thread (P2 tally finding) is resolved.

### Governance and security acceptance

The repository is private. Current main metadata reports `protected: false`; rulesets and branch-protection reads return HTTP 403, with GitHub requiring GitHub Pro or public visibility for rulesets. Issue [#47](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/issues/47) remains open. Historical November 2 ruleset evidence is not current enforcement evidence. Issue [#84](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/issues/84) confirms Code Scanning is disabled and Dependency Graph / GitHub Advanced Security is unavailable or not enabled for the current private-repository configuration. Owner action is required; do not remove or bypass either required security workflow.

Issue [#64](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/issues/64) remains open. PR #70 DNS pinning and PR #79 redirect transport correction passed their own exact-head Validation, CodeQL, and Dependency Review runs, but remain separate/unmerged branches. PR #94's mixed-DNS/peer tests have not executed because its exact-head workflows failed before runner assignment. Integrated SSRF acceptance is not established.

### External acceptance gates remain Blocked

- **#2 Main branch protection:** restore a supported private-repository plan/configuration and independently verify the active ruleset, exact required checks, human approval, last-push approval, thread resolution, and force-push/deletion protections.
- **#4 App Attest:** production Apple App ID/capability and provisioning entitlement, signed production build, and provider-backed enrollment/assertion verification on a supported physical iPhone.
- **#5 Play Integrity:** Play internal-track distribution, Play App Signing identity, Google Cloud service-account/API permissions, and verification on a physical Android installed from Play.
- **#16 Backup/restore:** production datastore/Redis backup access and a witnessed restore drill with measured recovery-point and recovery-time evidence.
- **#18 Product recognition:** representative labeled dataset, agreed accuracy metrics, human evaluation, and explicit business acceptance.
- **#21 Monitoring:** production monitoring workspace, alert destination, named on-call owner, thresholds, and witnessed alert-delivery test.
- **#22 Staged rollout:** production approval, TestFlight/Play track access, rollout/stop thresholds, named rollback owner, and tested rollback.
- **#25 Pilot/business validation:** real pilot cohort, documented success/stop thresholds, named business owner, participant safeguards, and explicit business/release approval.

The 25-point register remains **2 Done / 15 In Progress / 8 Blocked**. No physical-device, production-cloud, backup/restore, monitoring, rollout, pilot, or business acceptance item may be promoted based on CI, simulator, or emulator evidence.

The releases endpoint currently returns **0 published GitHub releases**. Code Scanning, Dependabot, and Secret Scanning alert inventories remain **unavailable/unverified, not empty**. Production/pilot acceptance remains **NOT GRANTED**.

PR #85 remains open at exact HEAD `e3d99b1f58b2133318d168ec4c20e58b515cf2c2`, 3 commits ahead / 0 behind main. Its exact-head Validation [43533470828](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43533470828) was **cancelled**: backend and iOS passed, but frontend was cancelled during the Android native Release Gradle build; Android build completion, emulator smoke, and runtime dependency audit are not established.

Dependency Review [43533471028](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43533471028) **failed** because GitHub reports the feature unsupported on this repository and requires Dependency Graph plus GitHub Advanced Security. These are not passing checks and no parent CI is substituted. The single P2 tally thread is resolved; the one COMMENTED review submission is anchored to an earlier commit, with no approval on current HEAD.

### Governance blocker

The repository is private; current `main` reports `protected: false`. The rulesets API returns HTTP 403 requiring GitHub Pro or public visibility.

### Documentation PR #85 exact-head results

Before this refresh, PR #85 exact HEAD was `ab302518de26a798fc417b22a32bda10376fcf11`. Its Validation [43520112435](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43520112435) failed because the frontend job exhausted runner disk space while downloading the Android emulator system image; backend and iOS jobs passed, but emulator smoke/runtime dependency audit did not complete. CodeQL [43520112498](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43520112498) failed after SARIF export because Code Scanning is not enabled and the action could not access workflow-run metadata. Dependency Review [43520112508](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43520112508) failed because Dependency Review is unsupported without the required Dependency Graph/GitHub Advanced Security capability. This new documentation commit has its own exact-head checks; no prior run is substituted.

These results establish automated CI acceptance for the merged code. They do **not** establish production or pilot acceptance.

### Governance blocker after repository privatization

The repository is private. The current main branch API reports `protected: false`; the rulesets API returns 403 and requires GitHub Pro or public repository visibility. Issue [#47](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/issues/47) has been reopened. Do not assume the previously verified ruleset remains enforced. Owner action is required to restore and verify main protection.

### External acceptance gates remain blocked

- **#4 App Attest:** production Apple App ID/capability and provisioning entitlement, signed production build, and provider-backed enrollment/assertion verification on a supported physical iPhone.
- **#5 Play Integrity:** Play internal-track distribution, Play App Signing identity, Google Cloud service-account/API permissions, and verification on a physical Android installed from Play.

Expo Doctor passed 20/21 checks but reported four Expo SDK 57 patch mismatches. Backend and iOS Validation jobs passed; CodeQL [#43463804128](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43463804128) and Dependency Review [#43463804149](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43463804149) passed on that exact pre-integration HEAD.

The remediation candidate in draft PR [#65](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/pull/65), exact HEAD `678fe7fde32f4dc785288d5a8ac939f1ac6478f0`, passed its own Validation [#43452488602](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43452488602), CodeQL [#43452493289](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43452493289), and Dependency Review [#43452488754](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43452488754). Its tested dependency, workflow, and regression-test changes are included in this integration commit. **The integration commit has a new exact-head CI gate and is not accepted until all required checks pass for that resulting SHA.** Parent and candidate CI results are not substituted for the integration commit's own results. PR #65 remains draft/open and has not been merged.

PR #41 remains open and unmerged. Its current review inventory before this integration was 22/22 inline threads resolved, 25 review submissions, and **0 human APPROVED**. The active main ruleset [26370589](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/rules/26370589) requires six strict status checks, one approving review, approval of the last push, and resolved review threads. Issue [#47](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/issues/47) is closed.

Issue [#64](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/issues/64) remains open. DNS-pinning PR #70 and redirect-chain fix PR #79 each passed their own exact-head Validation, CodeQL, and Dependency Review. Human review and integration are still required; no production deployment or exploit is claimed.

The repository has **0 published GitHub releases**. Code Scanning, Dependabot, and Secret Scanning alert inventories are **unverified, not zero** because the connected integration does not expose those endpoints.

### External acceptance requirements remain blocked

- **#4 App Attest:** production Apple App ID/capability and provisioning entitlement, signed production build, and provider-backed enrollment/assertion test on a supported physical iPhone.
- **#5 Play Integrity:** Play internal-track distribution, Play App Signing identity, Google Cloud service-account/API permissions, and verification on a physical Android installed from Play.
- **#16 Backup/restore:** witnessed production backup and restore with measured recovery point and recovery time.
- **#18 Product accuracy:** representative labelled dataset, measured accuracy, human evaluation, and business acceptance.
- **#21 Monitoring:** production metrics/log pipeline, named on-call owner, and verified alert delivery/acknowledgement.
- **#22 Rollout:** approved staged rollout gates, monitoring thresholds, named rollback owner, and tested rollback.
- **#25 Pilot:** real-user cohort, measured acceptance criteria, participant safeguards, and business sign-off.

The 25-point register remains **3 Done / 15 In Progress / 7 Blocked**. Simulator/emulator evidence does not satisfy physical-device, production, backup/restore, monitoring, rollout, pilot, or business acceptance.

## Latest acceptance checkpoint — 2026-11-11 21:40 CET

**Automated CI acceptance for validated parent PR #41 HEAD 4883c652d61b93236b7a604f124bf5708caa07e6: PASSED. The documentation-only child created by this checkpoint has its own exact-head CI gate. Pilot/production acceptance: NOT GRANTED.**

PR #41 remains open, unmerged, and non-draft on fix/release-blockers-2026-10, targeting main.

### Exact-head automated evidence for parent 4883c65

All three required workflows completed successfully for the same exact SHA:

- Validation [#43090044324](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43090044324):
  - Backend [130764391957](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43090044324/job/130764391957): success.
  - Frontend/Android [130764391800](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43090044324/job/130764391800): success, including unit tests, pinned Expo Doctor, Android export/Release build, emulator install/launch smoke, and runtime dependency audit.
  - iOS [130764391399](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43090044324/job/130764391399): Release simulator build and install/launch smoke passed.
- CodeQL [#43090044306](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43090044306), analyze [130764391156](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43090044306/job/130764391156): success.
- Dependency Review [#43090044397](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43090044397), job [130764390843](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43090044397/job/130764390843): success; no high-or-higher vulnerable package in the reviewed diff and no denied package.

The unchanged validated source/test baseline 2faa49c records 450 backend tests, 27 production-readiness checks, 78 security/privacy checks, 285 frontend tests across 58 files, Expo Doctor 21/21, Android Release/emulator smoke, and iOS Release simulator/smoke. Those detailed counts belong to the unchanged source/test baseline; the exact 4883c65 documentation descendant independently reran all three workflows successfully.

### Remaining dependency and security findings

- Runtime npm audit: four moderate transitive glob/minimatch findings; no high-or-higher finding at the configured high threshold.
- Dependency Review metadata: unknown license metadata for vendor/deepmerge@4.3.2; Scorecard results below threshold for @expo/devcert (2.9) and is-mergeable-object (1.5).
- CodeQL succeeded with a previously observed non-fatal SARIF column-kind mismatch warning.
- Code Scanning, Dependabot, and Secret Scanning alert inventories remain **unverified, not zero** because the connected integration does not expose their alert endpoints.

### Review and governance

- The Codex review of 4883c65 raised two P2 documentation findings. This child restores the operational release procedures and distinguishes the validated parent from the new documentation HEAD; both corresponding threads are resolved after the push.
- At pre-write capture: 20 inline threads total, 18 resolved and 2 open; 24 review submissions, 0 APPROVED. A fresh Codex review is requested for this documentation child. Human approving review and last-push approval remain mandatory.
- Issue [#47](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/issues/47) is closed. Active main ruleset [26370589](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/rules/26370589) enforces six strict checks, one approval, last-push approval, resolved-thread enforcement, deletion/non-fast-forward protection, and no bypass actors.
- Main HEAD: 7ef22a6114d88c4a7e7aff7f9ab48544c7d18bf0. The release branch was 512 commits ahead and 0 behind immediately before this documentation-only child.
- Repository inventory: 32 branches, 19 open PRs, 4 open non-PR issues (#46, #25, #24, #23). GitHub Releases API returns 0 published releases.

### External acceptance requirements

- **#4 App Attest:** Apple production App ID/capability and provisioning entitlement, signed production build, and supported physical iPhone enrollment/assertion test.
- **#5 Play Integrity:** Google Play internal-track distribution, Play App Signing certificate identity, Google Cloud service-account/API permissions, and verification on a physical Android installed from Play.
- **#16 Backup/restore:** witnessed production backup and restore with documented recovery point and recovery time.
- **#18 Product accuracy:** representative labelled image dataset, measured accuracy, human evaluation, and business acceptance.
- **#21 Monitoring:** production metrics/log pipeline, named on-call owner, and verified alert delivery/acknowledgement.
- **#22 Rollout:** approved staged rollout gates, monitoring thresholds, named rollback owner, and tested rollback.
- **#25 Pilot:** real-user pilot cohort, measured acceptance criteria, participant safeguards, and business sign-off.

The repository currently has no eas.json; a reviewed EAS production build profile and external store-signing configuration must be created before store artifacts can be treated as ready. Simulator/emulator evidence does not satisfy physical-device, production, backup/restore, monitoring, rollout, pilot, or business acceptance.

**Automated CI acceptance for exact parent 4883c65: PASSED. The new documentation child remains a separate CI gate. Pilot/production acceptance: NOT GRANTED. Do not merge automatically or bypass required checks.**

No separate post-merge Dependency Review run is claimed.

### PR #85 — current exact-head documentation gate

PR [#85](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/pull/85) remains open and unmerged on `docs/post-merge-release-evidence-20261113`, targeting `main`. Exact HEAD: `f0453516349d892cc7fd2f0a4769d9a201262c23`; base/main HEAD: `f03d2390f5ee8a6c549e2466c2c1a5844e08fbc1`. The branch is 7 commits ahead / 0 behind main and changes the three release-record files. The P2 status-tally review thread `PRRT_kwDOSkaDTM63ShCN` is resolved (1/1). One COMMENTED review submission is recorded, anchored to older commit `74e0eea7b00e8d4706e04b89018830fa75487473`; no human approval for the current PR #85 head is recorded.

All three required workflows for exact HEAD `f0453516349d892cc7fd2f0a4769d9a201262c23` completed with **failure**:

- Validation [43549057054](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43549057054): backend job [132307033357](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43549057054/job/132307033357), frontend job [132307033548](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43549057054/job/132307033548), and iOS job [132307033585](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43549057054/job/132307033585) all failed before runner assignment.
- CodeQL [43549057083](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43549057083): analyze job [132307033644](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43549057083/job/132307033644) failed before runner assignment.
- Dependency Review [43549057067](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43549057067): dependency-review job [132307033322](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43549057067/job/132307033322) failed before runner assignment.

The raw GitHub jobs API confirms all five jobs were created/started at 2026-11-14 02:57:18 UTC and completed within 1–2 seconds, with `runner_id: 0`, empty `runner_name`, empty `steps`, and no log URL. The step endpoint returned no steps and log downloads returned HTTP 404 `BlobNotFound`. This is evidence of a pre-runner allocation/dispatch failure; it is **not** evidence that application tests ran and failed, nor that they passed. The precise GitHub-side cause remains unverified.

Separately, issue [#84](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/issues/84) records repository-level security capability blockers on other exact heads: Code Scanning is not enabled for this private repository, and Dependency Graph / GitHub Advanced Security is unavailable or not enabled under the current configuration. Those independently verified blockers remain owner actions; they are not inferred from the no-runner jobs above. Do not remove, skip, or weaken CodeQL or Dependency Review.

### SSRF security issue #64

Issue [#64](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/issues/64) remains open. PR #70 exact HEAD `935cb0a6b88810696849f93c61a336541ce50914` passed Validation [43433697438](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43433697438), CodeQL [43433697081](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43433697081), and Dependency Review [43433697108](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43433697108). PR #79 exact HEAD `109e77ba8ccd78d42d4c4dc9cc0d557c98c0d902` passed Validation [43447696077](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43447696077), CodeQL [43447695973](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43447695973), and Dependency Review [43447695950](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43447695950). These remain separate open branches and are not integrated acceptance on `main`.

PR #94 adds deterministic mixed-DNS and peer-validation regression tests at exact HEAD `902d96b06fc033d3642192d429c69b940641d13d`, but Validation [43549425659](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43549425659) failed before runner assignment: all three jobs had zero steps, empty runner names, and no logs. The tests were not executed. CodeQL [43549425705](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43549425705) and Dependency Review [43549425785](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/actions/runs/43549425785) also failed under the repository-level configuration blockers recorded in #84. Keep #64 open until #94 receives an actually executed exact-head Validation, human review, and integration. The #79 deterministic transport tests use an injected network backend; they do not claim a live external socket or TLS handshake.

### Governance, inventory, and release decision

The repository remains private. Issue [#47](https://github.com/milanradics89-beep/POS-Doctor/issues/47) remains open. The last observed main branch metadata reported `protected: false`; the current branch-protection read returns HTTP 403, and the rulesets endpoint returns HTTP 403 with GitHub's requirement to upgrade the private repository plan or make the repository public. Current enforcement therefore remains unverified; the November 2 ruleset evidence is historical, not proof of current protection.

The releases API currently returns an empty list: **0 published GitHub releases**. The branch search returned 66 branches; the current issue search returned 39 open pull requests and 7 open issues. Code Scanning, Dependabot, and Secret Scanning alert inventories remain **unavailable/unverified, not empty**. The Code Scanning feature/configuration issue is tracked separately in #84.

The 25-point register remains **2 Done / 15 In Progress / 8 Blocked**. Done: #1 and #6. Blocked: #2, #4, #5, #16, #18, #21, #22, and #25. The other 15 remain In Progress. Pilot/production acceptance remains **NOT GRANTED**. Do not promote physical-device, production-cloud, witnessed backup/restore, monitoring, staged-rollout, real-user-pilot, or business-approval items based on CI, simulator, or emulator evidence.
